# Image Recognition Using Neural Networks.
Built this project in Python

Took a Dataset of images containing over 30000 images of Dogs, Cats,Food.
* Created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Alex-Net Deep Learning model.
* This defined model had 5 convolutional layers with ReLU as activation function.
* Analyzed different types of images to learn about Dogs, Cats and Food in order to recognize each image.
* The evaluated accuracy of the model resulted in 95.63%.
* Utilized Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib in this project.Took a Dataset of images containing over 30000 images of Dogs, Cats,Food.
